XFCE4-WEATHER-PLUGIN
==========================================================================
You can always find up-to-date information at the plugin homepage:
http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-weather-plugin


ABOUT
==========================================================================
Originally written by Bob Schlärmann, this panel plugin shows
information about your local weather in the panel, using forecast data
provided by met.no.


USAGE
==========================================================================
The first time you open the configuration dialog, the weather plugin
automatically configures itself to fetch weather data from a place
which should be near you - based on your IP address.

You can change this location using the Change... button, and searching
for the city, country, address, monument etc. you're interested
in. Only latitude and longitude will be used for the data requests, so
you can edit the location name to something you like.

In this configuration screen, you can also choose which information
you want visible in the panel.

On the panel icon, a middle click forces an update, left click brings
up a forecast and details page. Right-clicking opens the contextual
menu.


INFORMATION FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS AND DISTRIBUTORS
==========================================================================
If you're going to distribute this package, please be so kind and set
the GEONAMES_USERNAME configure option for the GeoNames web service
which is used for altitude detection. GeoNames requires you to
register an account and limits requests on a per-hour and per-day
basis to prevent misuse of their service. There are no other
restrictions and registration is free, uncomplicated and takes less
than a minute (http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html).
Performing these steps will ensure the altitude detection continues
to work for all users of the plugin.


MET.NO API DOCUMENTATION
==========================================================================
To get a quick overview, please consolidate the met.no API weather
documentation and especially their FAQ, which answers some questions
left open by the former:

* General documentation and data licensing
  http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/documentation
  http://api.yr.no/faq.html
  http://api.met.no/license_data.html

* Service-specific documentation
  http://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecastlts/1.1/documentation
  http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/documentation

For more technical details you might need to study the XML schema
corresponding to the document in question.


DEBUGGING AND REPORTING BUGS
==========================================================================
Before reporting bugs or asking for new features, please consolidate
the Xfce bug tracker at https://bugzilla.xfce.org and check the TODO
file, because your issue or request might have been reported already
or be in planning. However, feel free to add any information not yet
mentioned that you find useful.

If you encounter problems like crashes or weird behaviour, it might
prove insightful to enable panel debugging as follows:

1) Quit the current running panel instance using 'xfce4-panel -q'.
2) Set the PANEL_DEBUG environment variable to 'weather' or 'all':
   export PANEL_DEBUG=weather
3) Start the panel and let it write its output to a file, e.g.:
   xfce4-panel > panel.log 2>&1 & disown
4) Watch output using tail -f or less or whatever you like:
   tail -f panel.log

This will make the plugin explain what it's currently doing and dump
data it downloaded from the various sources. More information about
debugging panel plugins can be obtained from several pages of the Xfce
Wiki at https://wiki.xfce.org.

It's also relatively easy and often very helpful to create a backtrace
using gdb or any other debugger should the plugin crash:

1) Find the process ID of the weather plugin with something like
   'pgrep -f libweather.so'. Let's assume the resulting PID is 1234.
2) Attach the GNU debugger to that process: 'gdb attach 1234'.
3) The plugin will be frozen now. Tell the debugger to let it continue
   with the 'cont' command.
4) Produce the crash if possible, or wait until it crashes.
5) GDB will detect the crash and freeze the plugin again. Use 'bt' to
   print a nice backtrace. Report the issue to the Xfce bugtracker at
   https://bugzilla.xfce.org, providing the backtrace.
6) 'quit' exits the debugger.


ICON THEMES
==========================================================================

1) Icon theme support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of 0.8.3, xfce4-weather-plugin supports icon themes. This requires
a specific icon naming scheme that corresponds to the met.no API
symbols definition. Icon sets following the freedesktop.org
standardized naming scheme are not supported because they lack too
many icons the plugin would need for the various weather conditions
provided by met.no, so adhereing to the standard wouldn't make much
sense (see 2) for more information ).

If you want to design your own set, please have a look at the default
Liquid theme that is included in this package to get an idea what the
icons should look like and at the source file weather-translate.c,
where you will find references and explanations for the weather
symbols.

The plugin searches for icon themes in the following directories, in
this particular order:
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xfce/weather/icons
$(datadir)/icons

Where
* $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is usually /home/user/.config
* $(datadir) is whatever you configured it to be on build-time, like
  /usr/local/share/xfce4/weather/icons or
  /usr/share/xfce4/weather/icons

In these directories the plugin shall find subdirectories that contain
the icon themes. Let's look at the structure by example of the Liquid
theme (files or directories in brackets [] are optional):

Liquid
|--22
|--48
|--128
\--theme.info

The theme.info file needs to be present, or the plugin will not
consider the directory a valid icon theme. This file should contain
the following entries:
------------------------------- theme.info -------------------------------
Name=Liquid
Author=Unknown
Description=Modified icon theme originating from the Superkaramaba Liquid Weather plugin
License=GPL-2
-------------------------- theme.info ends here --------------------------

Make sure that each entry is on one line. Entries may not span
multiple line, the additional lines will be ignored. These values will
be shown in the theme selection in the configuration dialog.

Directories 22, 48 and 128 shall contain the icons at approximately
the size the directory names suggest. Icon sizes for the panel icon
will be chosen depending on the panel size. For the tooltip, the icon
will be taken from the 128 directory, and medium sized icons (48) for
the forecast window and similar places.

Here is a list showing which icon sizes are recommended for the
various panel sizes:

Directory   Panel size    Recommended icon sizes
22          16-23         22, 24, 16
48          24-48         48, 24, 32
128         49-128        128, 96, 80, 64

To be found by the plugin, the icons need to be named exactly as
follows (listed in alphabetical order):

* cloud.png
* fog.png
* lightcloud.png
* lightrain.png
* lightrainsun.png
* lightrainthunder.png
* lightrainthundersun.png
* nodata.png
* partlycloud.png
* rain.png
* rainthunder.png
* sleet.png
* sleetsun.png
* sleetsunthunder.png
* sleetthunder.png
* snow.png
* snowsun.png
* snowsunthunder.png
* snowthunder.png
* sun.png

At night time, the plugin will first look for icons having a "-night"
suffix, e.g. cloud-night.png, lightrainsun-night.png etc. The rest of
the filename needs to be the same as for the day icon, and the icons
should probably look similar, however with brother sun replaced by
sister moon. Of course, the latter is rather a design decision than a
technical necessity. If no night icon is provided, the plugin will
fallback to using the day icon.

An exception is the NODATA icon, which has no night variant. Further,
it will only be shown when the plugin has not been configured yet -
but then more likely only the NODATA icon of the default theme will
appear and not that of your theme -, or when there is no data
available, for example in case of a network error. It also serves as
the fallback icon for all missing day icons. Finally, if you do not
provide a NODATA icon for your theme, then the one of the default
theme will be used which is assumed to always be present.

As is indirectly conveyed by this list, all files need to be in PNG
format.

All icon sets included and distributed in the xfce4-weather-plugin
package are under GPL by default. If an icon set differs from this
license, please put an extra LICENSE file in the theme directory.

2) Freedesktop standardized naming scheme
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was suggested (http://mail.xfce.org/pipermail/xfce/2012-August/031180.html)
to make use of icon themes implementing the freedesktop standardized naming
scheme, like some KDE and GNOME application do, for reference please see
http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html.

This might not be such a good idea, however, because
* the standard only provides a limited set of weather icons which will
  not be enough to represent all possible conditions the weather plugin
  can show,
* it is unclear what to do when those icons are missing, and solving
  this in a good manner will make things unnecessarily complicated for
  the plugin,
* with the Liquid icon set there already is a good default icon set that
  suits most users,
* the deficiences of the Liquid theme can be solved more easily with
  proper theming support and a bit of editing (providing an
  alternative Liquid theme for dark panels).

Of course, you might take any such freedesktop compliant theme as the
basis for your personal new icon set, so you only have to design or
assemble the remaining few icons. And finally, with a bit of searching
you can find lots of free-to-use icons and icon sets on the web!

3) The "Liquid" icon theme and its license
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In August 2012 a question was raised about the license of the Liquid
icon theme (see http://mail.xfce.org/pipermail/xfce/2012-August/031178.html
and http://mail.xfce.org/pipermail/xfce/2012-August/031188.html for
further discussion), so let's elaborate a bit on that.

According to original author of the plugin, Bob Schlärmann, the
"Liquid" icon theme originates from the now abandoned "Liquid Weather"
package for KDE Superkaramba and has been part of the weather plugin
since around 2004. While this is not 100% certain, it is supposed to
be licensed under GPL-2, as is the "Liquid Weather" script.

Unfortunately, the Liquid Weather website at liquidweather.net is no
more, and so obtaining the script package is a bit difficult and
requires searching for mirrors. A link that still works at the time of
this writing is:
ftp://ftp.wanadoo.nl/pub/mirrors/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/lwp-15.0.skz

However, trying to contact the developers of Liquid Weather in
September 2012 for verification about this issue did not yield any
response.

An archived version of the website which contains information about
the previously available icon sets and the license is still available at
http://web.archive.org/web/20100724155753/http://liquidweather.net/icons.php:
"On this page, you'll find additional iconsets and backgrounds for
liquid weather ++ - please note that the backgrounds are not easily
installable with versions earlier than v9.0. With the exception of the
weather.com, Beginning and Um icons, I believe that these iconsets are
either GPL or available for redistribution. If I am wrong, please let
me know and I'll remove them. Please note that the weather.com icons
are used with permission of the weather.com website, and the Beginning
and Grzanka icons are used with the permission of their authors. This
means that these iconsets may not be copied, modified or redistributed
without permission. The same applies to the Umicons included in the
core liquid weather tarball."

A further look at http://kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=6384,
brings forth this bit of information: "License: Everything is GPL,
EXCEPT FOR some of the icon sets, which are distributed with the
permission of their authors." Looking at the archived web page above,
the Liquid weather icon set is not to be found in the exceptions list,
so according to that it should be GPL. Besides, the similarity of the name of both
the icon set and its containing package also hints to that licensing.

To sum it all up, the icon theme is considered licensed under GPL too,
though its original author remains unknown. If someone can resolve this,
please send a mail to the current maintainer of the weather plugin, and
he/she will give proper credit.
