"Named after the astronomer Anders Celsius who invented the original scale in "

"difference in temperature is exactly the same difference as 1 K. It is "
"defined with the melting point of water being roughly at 0 °C and its "
"boiling point at 100 °C at one standard atmosphere (1 atm = 1013.5 hPa). "
"Until 1948, the unit was known as <i>centigrade</i> - from Latin <i>centum</"

"chloride. The melting point of water is at 32 °F and its boiling point at "
"212 °F. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect at -40 degrees. Even in "
"cold winters, the temperatures usually do not fall into negative ranges on "
"the Fahrenheit scale.\n"
"With its inventor being a member of the Royal Society in London and having a "
"high reputation, the Fahrenheit scale enjoyed great popularity in many "
"English-speaking countries, but was replaced by the Celsius scale in most of "
"these countries during the metrification process in the mid to late 20th "
