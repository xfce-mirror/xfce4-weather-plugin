msgstr "The amount of rain, drizzle, sleet, hail, snow, graupel and other forms of water falling from the sky over a specific period.\n\nThe values reported by met.no are those of precipitation in the liquid state - or in other words: of rain -, so if snow is expected (but not sleet), then the amount of snow will be <i>guessed</i> by multiplying the original value by a ratio dependent on the air temperature:\n\n<tt><small>                   T &lt; -11.1 °C (12 °F) =&gt; 1:12\n-11.1 °C (12 °F) &lt; T &lt;  -4.4 °C (24 °F) =&gt; 1:10\n -4.4 °C (24 °F) &lt; T &lt;  -2.2 °C (28° F) =&gt; 1:7\n -2.2 °C (28 °F) &lt; T &lt;  -0.6 °C (31 °F) =&gt; 1:5\n -0.6 °C (31 °F) &lt; T                    =&gt; 1:3\n\n</small></tt>Example: If temperature is -5 °C (12 °F), then snow density will be low and a rain to snow ratio of 1:10 will be used for calculation. Assuming the reported value is 5 mm, then the calculated amount of snow precipitation is 50 mm.\n\n<b>Note</b>: While air temperature is an important factor in this calculation, there are other influencing factors that the plug-in doesn't know about like the type of snow and ground temperature. Because of that, these rules will only lead to rough estimates and may not represent the real amount of snow."
